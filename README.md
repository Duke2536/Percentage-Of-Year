# Percentage-Of-Year
Basic program that calculates how many days out of the year have completed, to give a percentage of year's completion.

This program also provides a user input option to calculate any date with consideration of leap year. However the program is **strictly typed** and will throw various custom exceptions if these requirements are not met:

  **-Date input must be in total numeric value of MM/DD/YY or MM/DD/YYYY, Months like ("November") cannot be input**
  
  -Date input must give respect to either spacing or slashes (such as: MM DD YYYY, MM/DD/YYYY, or a combination of spaces and slashes)
              [If the user inputs only 2 numbers for a year, it will automatically assume it is under the 21st century]
  
  -When requesting to exit the program, or run a command it must be in the exact notaton (i.e. COMMANDS)
  -When requesting for a file clearing the file must contain data

time_saved.txt is the file that contains all data given from user input, an example of the notation is shown
        [the example in time_saved.txt can be deleted if you choose to, it is merely an example]

This program is intended to be thoroughly commented to reduce confusion, [program is intended for organizational optimization, not performance]

Small bug fixes and / or extensions are intended, yet not constantly.
